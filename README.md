## A WIP cross-platform Client (Upload/Download) for the HRCloud2 Platform

The HRCloud2-Client App was ported from Gihub user Jacklam718/ftp on 5/3/2017. 

It is a slightly modified (as-of-yet) version of the original, compiled to .exe for cross-platform support from interpreted Python to a compiled binary that can be run on many platforms with PyInstaller.

Stay-tuned for updates that enable functionality!
