# HRCloud2-Client
A cross-platform desktop client for the HRCloud2 Platform.

# This repo was forged from https://github.com/jacklam718/ftp!!!

# A WIP cross-platform Client (Upload/Download) for the HRCloud2 Platform

The HRCloud2-Client App was ported from Gihub user Jacklam718/ftp on 5/3/2017. 

It is a slightly modified (as-of-yet) version of the original, compiled to .exe for cross-platform support from interpreted Python to a compiled binary (.exe) that can be run on many platforms.

Stay-tuned for updates that enable functionality!
